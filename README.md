# Project_PRIM
The Database include two parts: profile.bson and skill.bson(too large to upload on the github). The profils database contains the skill, the job, the working expenience and so on of a person.The skill database contains relations among different skills.
The company tries to develop a job-recommending system. In the first part, for people who want to follow his previous job, we need to match a  profile with same or similar skills, and than extract the experience as reference.
The second part is related to the ontology, for people who want to change his job direction, we need to analyse what are their potential skills or the skills which may be easily acquired by them. By doing this, we tried to propose a totally different job advice.
Still, we are following the instructions given by the the company.
